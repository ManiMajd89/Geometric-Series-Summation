# Geometric Series Summation

This project demonstrates the calculation and comparison of the analytical solution and partial sums of a geometric series using MATLAB. The script includes both iterative and vectorized methods to compute the sums and visualizes their convergence to the analytical value through a clear and informative plot.

## Features

- Analytical calculation of geometric series sum.
- Iterative and vectorized computation of partial sums.
- Visualization of results with MATLAB plots.

## Usage

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/Geometric-Series-Summation.git

2.	Open geometric_series_sum.m in MATLAB.

3.	Run the script to view results and plot.
